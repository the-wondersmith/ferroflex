           CS&L Installation Program for CS&L REV 2.3b 
    Copyright (C) 1988 Data Access Corp, All rights reserved.

    Thank you for purchasing the DataFlex C Source & Library

This program will install the DataFlex C Source & Library on your 
hard disk.  Due to the many variables associated with this 
installation, it is necessary that you have completely read the 
installation notes.  Before proceeding, you should have the 
answers to the following questions: 

          - Directory that Turbo-C software resides
          - Directory to install CS&L Source files
          - Directory to install CS&L Library files
          - Directory to install CS&L Include files
          - FULL DATAFLEX DEVELOPMENT LICENSE directory

The names of the default directories have been arbitrarily 
chosen, and may be renamed at your descretion.

As a precaution, all files should be backed up, since the 
installation program will overwrite any pre-existing files with 
the same name. ^


            Additional notes concerning installation



The environment variable COMSPEC must point to a valid 
command.com.  Otherwise, various COPY commands may not function.  
If the installation appears to be skipping over groups of files, 
check this environment variable, and re-run the installation 
program.  ^


               Additional notes concerning linking



If you link with the /D option to display duplicate symbols, you 
will be alerted of the following duplicate symbols:

         _SETCOLOR           _MATHERR            _GOTOXY
         _CLOSEGRAPHICS      _EOF                _LOCK
         _DISPLAY            _FREEMEM            _UNLOCK

This is because the programs you are creating draw their 
functions from libraries that come from different manufacturers.  
Any particular manufacturer may have a library function that is 
defined by another manufacturer.  These messages are harmless and 
should be ignored.  ^
